# Installation

## Installation including Data Files

Some examples use large model output data files stored using Git LFS (https://git-lfs.com/).

If you have Git LFS installed, these files will be downloaded automatically when you clone the repository:

```bash
git lfs install
git clone https://github.com/jjung11/Mshpy.git
```

If you cloned the repo before installing Git LFS, run:

```bash
git lfs pull
```

After cloning, install the package:

```
cd Mshpy
pip install .
```
